In this folder, there exists documentation on certain internal-only Roblox APIs. I have documented them for future reference, and research.

It must be noted that there exists no way for an average user to access these APIs. And these APIs may change or be removed at any time. I also possess no responsibility about the data-loss or corruption that may occur due to incorrect usage of these APIs. If you're willing to use them, use carefully.
