To Install, go to:
Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\<userID>\CustomRibbonTabs`
MacOS: `~/Documents/Roblox/<userID>/CustomRibbonTabs`

And simply drop all of the `.json` files (or the ones you would like) to the folder.
Then, if the studio is open, reload the custom tabs through the Manage Tabs menu, and they should all appear.
After that, you can reorder or disable some of them if you wish.

Enjoy.
