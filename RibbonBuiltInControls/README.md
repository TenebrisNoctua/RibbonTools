In the `Dump.json` file, there exists all of the available built-in controls of Roblox Studio. This can be used for creating custom tools and plugins related to them.

However, I do have to note that to save from bandwith and memory usage, certain properties do not exist in the json. Those properties are generally only useful in the context of the Ribbon, and externally useless.

(Note: The Icon property on certain actions do not exist, because they do not have icons. If icons are added for these actions in the future, feel free to open a PR or an issue about it.)
